# PythonMachineLearning
An end-to-end machine learning lifecycle of an LTSM model to predict stock market prices using Python (PyTorch) and Alpha Vantage APIs.

This is a fully functional Long short-term memory (LSTM) model that predicts the future stock price of IBM based on historical price movements. The single Python file develops, trains, and tests a machine learning model, then displays a chart of IBM's price at the next day's close.

This project follows Alpha Vantage's tutorial by Hong Jing located here: https://www.alphavantage.co/academy/#lstm-for-finance
